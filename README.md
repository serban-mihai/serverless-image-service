# Serverless Image-Service

The project is inspired by [Serverless Sharp](https://github.com/venveo/serverless-sharp) but doesn't seem to be maintained anymore. The core features have been kept, with some bugs being fixed while other features being temporarily cut. Some might be reintroduced in near future releases.
With this solution, you can get your image service without relying on other paid solutions from Cloud providers such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/), [Akamai](https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-image-and-video-manager), [Imgix](https://imgix.com/) to name a few.

The advantages of having your custom solution are flexibility, lower costs, and customization.

## About

The service is meant to be consumed from both a client App to fetch images from the GET route, and a CMS to manage static assets by uploading and removing them from an **AWS S3 Bucket** through the POST and DELETE routes.
It is capable of storing incoming binary data and serving outcoming images with additional processing for size and quality on-demand. Image processing is handled by the [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) library.

### Public S3 Bucket
Warning, this is enabled by default, if you deploy your **S3 Bucket** will have Host for Static Site enabled and access will be public!
Currently, I'm investigating how to **bypass the Lambda triggers** if the request has no query parameters aka. it doesn't require any processing over the image requested. Something might be achievable by **tweaking the API Gateway config** but I don't have a certain answer yet.
Anyway, the service is going to perfectly work with a private **S3 Bucket**, you can disable this by commenting the following lines in `serverless.yml` before deploying:
```
WebsiteConfiguration:
    IndexDocument: " "
PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
    BlockPublicAcls: false
    BlockPublicPolicy: false
    IgnorePublicAcls: false
    RestrictPublicBuckets: false
``` 
Alternatively, you can comment just the first 2 lines to disable Static Hosting and change the remaining values to be `true`

### Caching Strategy
The only CDN solution offered by this service is `AWS CloudFront`, which serves as **Caching** place for avoiding useless stress on `Lambda` in case of high traffic aka. many requests at once, `Lambda`'s free tier might be generous with 1M requests/month free, but why waste them? 
If you have access to an external CDN that can also **Cache** content from the Origin then it would be a good idea to register your `CloudFront` distribution as **Proxy** to a DNS and Cache there as well successful responses.

Depending on costs on both sides and overall traffic, by using this strategy you could easily use the entire solution for free!
More about this in my [article](https://serbanmihai.com/quests/serverless-image-service#)

#### GET - List Images
Gets a list of all the images in the **S3 Bucket** (currently limited to 1000 keys). It has been designed for **debugging purposes only**, but can be extended to list subpaths as well as being so integrated into CMS workflows.
> `GET` https://domain.com/

#### GET - Get Image
This endpoint has 2 purposes, based on receiving query parameters or not:
- `Without query params`: It returns the original file from the key provided (path + filename)
- `With query params`: Attempts to fetch the original file and processes it based on what options are supported before returning it.

For some codec and config reasons, some formats that are applied `q=70` or higher, output a bigger size image than the original.

#### POST - Upload Images
Uploads one or many images to a specific path inside an **S3 Bucket**. Once provided `/path/to/upload` the function will attempt to upload all the files provided under it, if any of the selected filenames are already contained inside the same path, it will throw a conflict error.

Note that this endpoint is supposed to receive a `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` payload format to work but this depends on the library or tool you use to make the request.
If using `fetch` or [Thunder](https://www.thunderclient.com/) for example you won't have to add the `Content-Type` header at all, since they handle the situation in the background, the header itself also contains a boundary that is used to mark the beginning and the end of the payload, as well as distinguish the various files, or parts, which it's composed of.
You'll still have to pass a **binary** of `multipart/form-data` as body on your request though.

The structure of the payload on the client-side looks like this:
```
{
  data: ImageBuffer.jpg
  data: ImageSecondBuffer.png
  data: ImageThirdBuffer.webp
  data: ...
}
```
The key for the `multipart/form-data` has to **always** be `data` because other metadata such as name and extension are already contained within the ImageBuffer that is in this case the binary representation of the image we want to upload, and they will be parsed back by Lambda once received in a correct form.

There are many ways to construct a valid payload compatible but it differs from the client App and its libraries.
> An example with **React/Next.js** is provided in the [related paragraph](#consuming-the-service-client-side)

The raw data, once reaches Lambda, due to API Gateway [policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-payload-encodings-workflow.html), it **forcefully encodes** the request body into `base64`, forcing Lambda to **decode it back** into `binary` if we want to parse it further from it's `multipart/form-data` format.
I still haven't found a hack for this, avoiding useless data transformation would be ideal since it would be less prone to bad parsing.

Once the data gets parsed, it's directly written on the **S3 Bucket** from the **Buffer** within the RAM, without being written on Lambda's ephemeral storage first.

- üü¢ Success:

#### DELETE - Remove Image
Removes images that correspond to the key (path + filename) provided with the request. The payload is an `application/json` that has the `images` key a list of string filenames to be removed within the path you invoked the function over. It can delete as many files as you pass to it. they just have to all be already stored within S3, if any of keys aren't available will throw an error, if all files have been deleted will return a successful message.

```
{
  "images": ["first.jpg","second.jpg", "thisDoesntExist.jpg"]
}
```

> `DELETE` https://domain.com/random/path

**It responds with:**

  }
  ```
## Setup

Clone and install NPM dependencies:
- `git clone https://github.com/serban-mihai/serverless-image-service.git`
- `cd serverless-image-service && npm i`

There are a couple of things to be done **before deploying**:
1. Create an AWS Certificate in [ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) on the `us-east-1` region that belongs to your `domain.com` and register the `CNAME` inside your external CDN or in [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). Also, remember to apply the necessary adjustments to your CDN for SSL/TLS traffic to avoid funky responses from API Gateway
2. Adjust `example-s3-bucket-policy.json` by changing the `<CUSTOM_DOMAIN>` with your `domain.com`. You will have multiple files for different environments if you use different domains or subdomains
3. Copy `example.settings.yml` to `settings.yml` and adjust missing values such as the `region`, `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`, and `ACM_CERTIFICATE_ARN` which is the ID of the Cert you created at step one. Note that the `SOURCE_BUCKET` and `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` will have to be equal within the same stage
4. Make sure not to already have an S3 Bucket on AWS with the same name of `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`
5. `Optional` Place inside `src/assets/` any **Watermark** of your choice to apply it further over images.
6. `Optional` If you don't want to include **GET** (List), **POST** and **DELETE** routes deployed you can just comment them in `serverless.yml`. That will just deploy the **GET** that will serve assets to clients, leaving up to you to upload manually assets within the `S3 Bucket` or integrate this operation with another service.

If you opt for not deploying POST and DELETE you can disable CORS as well on S3 resource sharing by commenting the following lines in `serverless.yml`:
```
CorsConfiguration:
  CorsRules:
    - AllowedMethods:
        - "POST"
        - "DELETE"
      AllowedOrigins:
        - "*"
      AllowedHeaders:
        - "*"
      ExposedHeaders:
        - "x-amz-server-side-encryption"
        - "x-amz-request-id"
        - "x-amz-id-2"
      MaxAge: 3000
```

The reason we are creating the Certificate in `us-east-1` is that for some reason AWS won't accept to create resources in other regions such as `eu-central-1` if the Certificate also belongs in `eu-central-1`
After the above points are checked everything should be ready to go for [deployment](#how-to-deploy).
- After the `CloudFormation Stack` deploys, add a `CNAME` of the created `CloudFront Distribution` within your **external CDN DNS** or **Route53** and **Proxy** traffic through it. The `distribution` looks like: `randomhash0123.cloudfront.net` and has to be assosiated with the name of your `S3 Bucket`.
> Record Example: **Type**: `CNAME` | **Name**: `my.domain.com` | **Value**: `randomhash0123.cloudfront.net` 

### Debugging
To debug endpoints I recommend the [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) extension for VSCode, it's feature-rich and has everything you need to send requests and debug endpoints. If you don't find yourself comfortable you can also use **Postman** instead, or `curl` if you're a true hardcore!

You can find both Thunder and Postman Collections and Environment in their directories inside the repo, they have predefined requests that cover all the functionality of the service, import them and change the environment accordingly with your **domain**, **path**, and **filename**

## Local Development

Before running the localhost environment consider importing into either **Thunder** or **Postman** their corresponding Collections and Environments.
You can keep the `*-local.json` and change just **filename** and **path** as you debug.

For local development `serverless-offline` plugin is used, to use it you first need to [Deploy](#how-to-deploy) it. After the deployment succeeds, you can run `sls offline --stage <YOUR_STAGE>` or from NPM `npm run offline:<YOUR_STAGE>` and use Thunder or Postman against the `local` Environment.

## How to Deploy

To deploy the app you can either use `sls deploy --stage <YOUR_STAGE>` if you have Serverless installed Globally, or use the NPN script desired you can find in `package.json`, ex `npm run deploy:dev` will deploy on **dev** environment.

At first, deployment is going to take a bit longer, future redeploys will end faster. If an error is returned while deploying, before swearing, you can check your stack in `AWS CloudFormation`, under events there is a remote chance to find something useful.
If this doesn't help feel free to open an issue üòÅ

If you plan to debug your remote environments (dev, staging, prod) you can use the **Thunder** and **Postman** Collections with the `*-prod.json` environment.
Just make sure to adjust the values for the env variables before.

## Differences from Venveo's service

Along with the edits to almost all the code structure, there are still a couple of things unchanged such as the security chunk.
### Improvements
- Switched from Object-Oriented to Functional programming paradigm
- Updated dependencies and Serverless version to V3
- Removed deprecated code on both Node and Serverless sides
- Included `upload`, `delete` and `list` of static assets
- S3 Bucket and Policy are created at deploy time based on the custom domain you want the service to run on
- Query params parser corrector, all defined query params (w, h, q) are recognized and applied to the returned image
- Fixed images paths without query params not being displayed
- Fixed image scale-up when `w=` and/or `h=` values are higher than the original image's width and/or height
- Packaged just the essential files within Lambdas
- Added Thunder Client and Postman Collections for easy debugging
- Removed Tests

### TODO
What needs to be addressed soon:
- [x] Add support for remaining [Resizing Operations](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize)
- [x] Add support for [Image Operations](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-operation)
- [x] Add support for [Color Manipulation](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-colour)
- [x] Add support for [Channel Manipulation](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-channel)
- [x] Personal favourite, add watermark with custom position, can be achieved with [Compositing](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-composite)
- [x] Add Images under each option in the Docs
- [x] Extend `DELETE` endpoint to remove multiple assets at once, similar to `POST` but reversed.
- [ ] Allow `Base64` encoding for long and explicit param values (Arrays and Objects)
- [ ] Create presets for popular transforms that can be applied all at once with a special query param and have priority over other query parameters
- [ ] Find a way to bypass Lambda when no query params are detected by API Gateway and get the asset from S3 Static Site (requires public access)
- [ ] Test the security `s=""` query parameter or change it with another solution
- [ ] Review security and `binaryMediaTypes` from API Gateway to disallow certain file types to be uploaded/served
- [ ] Test uploading other files besides images, restrict or let pass other MIME Types with a flag on Serverless
- [ ] Solve bugs within the image processing, such as the size being larger than the original with `q=70` or higher
- [ ] Test and ensure CloudFront's Cache working properly to avoid Lambda throttling
- [ ] Establish an efficient CLI Rollback of CloudFormation Stack from Serverless, it breaks because buckets related are not empty before removed
- [ ] Introduce Unit Tests back

## Consuming The Service Client-Side

On the client-side, the App needs to communicate with the service through any library that can send HTTP requests, while most endpoints are pretty straight forward there is one, in particular, that needs more work to make it work properly, the **Upload Image POST**
As described [above](#post---upload-images) needs to receive a POST request with a `binary multipart/form-data` body. Every framework/library has different ways to pack such an object, I'll show how I do it using **React/Next.js** and the `fetch` library.

```
import { useRef } from "react"

const App = () => {
  const form = useRef(null);

  const postImage = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const data = new FormData(form.current);
    const options = {
      method: "POST",
      body: data,
    };
    const res = await fetch("https://domain.com/random/path", options);
    const loaded = await res.json();
    console.log(loaded);
  };

  return(
    <div>
      <form
        ref={form}
        encType="multipart/form-data"
        onSubmit={postImage}
      >
        <input
          multiple
          type="file"
          placeholder="Upload"
          name="data"
          onChange={changeHandler}
        />
        <input
          type="submit"
          value="Post"
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```
The `FormData` is the interface you should be targetting when packing an object that contains the images you want to send over to be uploaded.

Most of the time you won't need to include any `Content-Type` header into the request, libraries know how to attach it automatically because the full header for such a request in its full form would look something like this `multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------157259096020916242283640002646`. That `boundary` is the separator between each object in the request, each image in our case. It generates when a `FormData` is created and the service is parsing this once the request gets to `Lambda`, and since you don't have to worry about it before sending the request, that's a win from both sides!

## Limits

Many limits are still unknown due to the early life of the project, this thing was just born üòÖ
- There is a limit of 10Mb max for payloads on the `POST` route, meaning you can't upload 50 images at once unless they're thumbnails
- I'm still breaking things, will update as soon as something happens...

## How to Contribute
If you want to contribute to the project just clone it, move to a branch with a simple naming convention `with-this-format` and push your branch, then open me a PR with some information about your changes and I'll take a look.
